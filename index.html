          <h3>1996–1998: Formative years</h3>
          <p>Sum 41 was formed by guitarist Deryck Whibley, drummer Steve Jocz, bassist Richard Roy and vocalist Jon
            Marshall. They were originally called Kaspir, and were a NOFX cover band.The group members decided to change
            the band's name for a Supernova show on September 28, 1996, which happened to be the 41st day of their
            summer vacation.</p>
          <p>Band manager and producer Greig Nori advised Whibley be the vocalist, causing Marshall to leave. With
            Whibley moving to lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Dave Baksh joined as lead guitarist.Early on; the band was
            involved in a near-fatal car accident, resulting in Roy leaving the band.Jason McCaslin was brought in on
            bass to complete the new line-up</p>

          <h3>2001–2003: All Killer No Filler and Does This Look Infected?</h3>
          <p>Sum 41's first full-length album, All Killer No Filler, was released on May 8, 2001 following an album
            release party at a record store in St. Louis, MO.The album was very successful; it was certified platinum by
            the Recording Industry Association of America in August 2001. "Fat Lip", the album's first single, achieved
            significant chart and commercial success; it topped the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart as well as
            many other charts around the world.The song remains the band's most successful to date. After "Fat Lip", two
            more singles were released from the album: "In Too Deep" and "Motivation". "In Too Deep" peaked at number 10
            on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, while "Motivation" peaked at number 24 on the same chart.The album peaked
            at number 13 on the Billboard 200 chart and at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums chart. The album was a
            commercial success, and was certified Platinum in the United States, Canada and in the UK.The album's name
            was taken from the initial reaction from Joe Mcgrath, an engineer working in the studio.</p>
          <p>The success of the album brought the band touring offers with mainstream bands such as Blink-182 and The
            Offspring.The band spent much of 2001 touring; the group played over 300 concerts that year before returning
            to the studio to record another album</p>
          <p>On November 26, 2002, the group released its second album, Does This Look Infected?The special edition came
            with a DVD, Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's. Whibley said of the album: "We don't want to make another
            record that sounds like the last record, I hate when bands repeat albums." The album featured a harder and
            edgier sound, and the lyrics featured a more serious outlook.The album peaked at number 32 on the Billboard
            200 chart and at number eight on the Top Canadian Albums chart.It was certified Platinum in Canada and gold
            in the United States, but was not as successful as its predecessor.</p>
          <p>The first single released from the album was "Still Waiting", which peaked at number seven on the Modern
            Rock Tracks chart.The second single, "The Hell Song" peaked at number 13 on the chart."The Hell Song"'s
            music video depicted the band members using dolls with their pictures on them and others, such as Korn,
            Kiss, AC/DC, Snoop Dogg, Destiny's Child, Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, and Pamela Anderson.The third
            single, "Over My Head (Better Off Dead)", had a video released exclusively in Canada and on the band's
            website, featuring live shots of the band.The video also appeared on the group's live DVD, Sake Bombs And
            Happy Endings (2003), as a bonus feature.The band again began a long tour to promote the album before
            recording the group's third studio album.</p>

          <h3>2006–2008: Underclass Hero, All the Good Shit and Baksh's departure</h3>
          <p>On May 10, 2006, Dave Baksh announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum
            41 to work with his new band, Brown Brigade, which has a more "classic metal" sound. Baksh cited "creative
            differences" as the reason for his departure, but claimed that he was still on good terms with the band.[51]
            The next day, Whibley confirmed Baksh's departure and announced that the band would only replace him with a
            touring guitarist, who would not have any decision-making power in the band or be in videos, photo shoots,
            or albums. The band hired Gob frontman and guitarist Tom Thacker to replace Baksh.</p>
          <p>Recording of the band's fourth studio album, Underclass Hero, began on November 8, 2006, and finished on
            March 14, 2007. On April 17, 2007, the band released a song on iTunes, "March of the Dogs". Although not a
            single, the band released it early because, according to Whibley, "the record [wouldn't] be out until the
            summer". Whibley was threatened with deportation for the song, because he metaphorically "killed the
            president" on it.</p>
          <p>The album, backed by the first single and title track, "Underclass Hero", was released on July 24,
            2007.[54] Despite mixed reviews, the album was a commercial success, debuting at number seven on the
            Billboard 200 and at number one on the Billboard Rock Albums chart, the band's highest US chart position to
            date. It also peaked at number one on the Canadian Albums chart and on the Alternative Albums chart, a first
            for the band on both the charts.[55] Two more singles were released from the album, "Walking Disaster" and
            "With Me". "With Me" especially found radio success by 2008. Underclass Hero was certified Platinum in
            Canada.</p>
          <p>In October 2007, the band began the Strength in Numbers Tour, a tour of Canada with Canadian band Finger
            Eleven; Die Mannequin opened each of Sum 41's shows. During the tour, Whibley sustained a herniated disk. As
            a result, the group cancelled the rest of its shows.[56] After Whibley recovered from his injury, the band
            continued the Underclass Hero tour in March 2008 and toured until early July, when the group began
            preparation for its next album</p>
          <p>Sum 41 released a greatest hits album in Japan titled 8 Years of Blood, Sake and Tears on November 26,
            2008. The album included a previously unreleased song, "Always", and a DVD, which contains each of the
            band's music videos.[58] On March 17, the band released the worldwide version of the album titled All the
            Good Shit.</p>

          <h3>2013–2014: Jocz's departure</h3>
          <p>On April 18, 2013, drummer Jocz announced he would be leaving the band on his official Facebook page,[82]
            leaving Whibley as the sole founding member of the band.</p>
          <p>On May 16, 2014, Deryck Whibley posted on his website, explaining that he had liver and kidney failure due
            to excessive drinking. He also said that he had some ideas for new songs, and that the band would be soon
            starting to make a new album.[84] On June 9, 2014, Whibley said on his Facebook page that he was working on
            new Sum 41 music out of his home studio to get ready to record some new tunes</p>
          <h3>2015–2018: Zummo's arrival, Baksh's return and 13 Voices</h3>
          <p>On July 9, 2015, the band launched a PledgeMusic campaign for its comeback album.[86] On July 23, 2015, the
            band played its comeback show at the Alternative Press Awards, which featured former lead guitarist Dave
            Baksh, joining the band on stage nine years after his departure. The band's set also featured DMC as guest.
            It also introduced Frank Zummo from Street Drum Corps as the new drummer. Sum 41 confirmed Baksh's official
            return to the band on August 14, 2015. On December 26, 2015, Sum 41 teased two new songs on their Instagram
            profile.</p>
          <p>The band performed on the 2016 Warped Tour.[88] On May 11, 2016, the group announced its signing to
            Hopeless Records.[89] The band announced on June 6, 2016 that their sixth album would be called 13 Voices
            and would be released on October 7, 2016. That same day, they also revealed album's track list and cover
            art.[90] The first song from the upcoming album, "Fake My Own Death", was released on June 28, 2016, through
            Hopeless Records' official YouTube channel, along with a music video for the song. The song was performed on
            The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on October 3, 2016. The album's first official single, "War", was
            released on August 25, 2016.[91] On September 28, 2016, the album's eighth track, "God Save Us All (Death to
            Pop)" was leaked online,[92] before being officially released (along with a live music video) on September
            29, 2016.[93] The band invited fans to record a music video for "Goddamn I'm Dead Again" that was released

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>1998–2000: Half Hour of Power</h3>
          <p>In 1998, the band recorded a demo tape on compact cassette which they sent to record companies in the hope
            of getting a recording contract. The tapes are considered rarities.</p>
          <p>From 1999 to 2000, the band recorded several new songs. The Introduction to Destruction and later the Cross
            The T's and Gouge Your I's DVDs both contain the self-recorded footage, which show the band performing a
            dance to "Makes No Difference" in front of a theatre</p>
          <p>After signing with Island Records in 1999, Sum 41's first EP, Half Hour of Power, was released on June 27,
            2000.The first single released by the band was "Makes No Difference", which had two different music
            videos.The first video was put together using the video clips sent to the record label, and the second
            showed the band performing at a house party.The album was certified platinum in Canada</p>

          <h3>2004–2005: Chuck</h3>
          <p>In late May 2004, the band traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo with War Child Canada, a branch of
            the British charity organization War Child, to document the country's civil war.[38] Days after arriving,
            fighting broke out in Bukavu near the hotel where the band was staying.[39] The band waited for the fighting
            to die down, but it did not. A UN peacekeeper, Charles "Chuck" Pelletier, called for armoured carriers to
            take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. After nearly twenty hours, the carriers arrived, and the
            band and forty other civilians were taken to safety.</p>
          <p>In honour of Pelletier, Sum 41 named its next album Chuck; it was released on October 12, 2004.[41] The
            album charted at number 10 on the Billboard 200 chart and on the Top Internet Albums chart. It also peaked
            at number two on the Canadian Albums chart and was the band's highest-charting album until it was surpassed
            by Underclass Hero. The album received positive reviews, and was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in
            the United States</p>
          <p>The first single from the album was "We're All To Blame", which peaked at number 10 on the Modern Rock
            Tracks chart. It was followed by "Pieces", a relatively soft song which reached the top of the charts in
            Canada. The next single was "Some Say", released only in Canada and Japan. The last single from the record
            was "No Reason", released at the same time as "Some Say", but with no music video. It was released only in
            Europe and the US, where it reached number 16 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart</p>
          <p>A documentary of the band's experience in Congo was made into a film called Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo and
            later aired on MTV. War Child released it on DVD on November 29, 2005, in the United States and Canada.</p>
          <p>Following the album's release, the band went on a tour with Good Charlotte until 2006.[47] On December 21,
            2005, Sum 41 released a live album, Happy Live Surprise, in Japan.[48][49] The CD contained a full concert
            recorded live in London, Ontario and was produced by Whibley. The same CD was released March 7, 2006, in
            Canada under the name Go Chuck Yourself.[48][49] The band played videos before its set that were deemed
            "unsuitable for children". Controversy arose over some of the videos' violent content.</p>

          <h3>2009–2012: Screaming Bloody Murder and Thacker's promotion</h3>
          <p>Drummer Steve Jocz confirmed that Tom Thacker was now an official member of Sum 41, and would take part in
            the writing and recording.[60] On November 5, 2009, Whibley posted a blog on the band's MySpace page
            announcing Gil Norton as the producer of the band's upcoming album, also saying that 20 songs were already
            written for the album.[61] In an interview with Tom Thacker, some working titles for songs for the new album
            were confirmed, including "Panic Attack", "Jessica Kill" and "Like Everyone Else".[62] Pre-production for
            the new album took 13 days in December 2009, with the band officially entering the studio to begin recording
            at Perfect Sound Studios on January 26, 2010. The new studio album, titled Screaming Bloody Murder,[63] was
            expected for a late 2010 release, but was delayed until early 2011.[64] The band finished recording on June
            24, 2010, just before joining the 2010 Warped Tour. While the group was on the tour, the new album entered
            the post-production stages of mixing and mastering.[64] A new song called "Skumfuk" was leaked online on
            July 6, 2010.[65] In an interview with Canoe.ca, Steve Jocz said that while producer Gil Norton was
            originally hired to engineer the new album, he was only around for a week and Sum 41 self-produced the
            record</p>
          <p>The first single from the album, "Screaming Bloody Murder", was released on February 7, 2011, in the United
            States.[66][67] The song had its worldwide premiere on January 14, 2011, on Windsor, Ontario radio station
            89X.[68] The album Screaming Bloody Murder was released in Japan on April 6, 2011.[69] On February 28, 2011,
            a stream of "Blood in My Eyes", another new song from the album, was released for free listening on
            Alternative Press.[70] On May 28, 2011, Sum 41 performed a live set for Guitar Center Sessions on DirecTV.
            The episode included an interview with program host Nic Harcourt</p>
          <p>"Baby You Don't Wanna Know" was released as the album's second single.[72] The band shot a music video for
            the song during a day off in Germany.[73] A music video was also produced for the first single, "Screaming
            Bloody Murder", but it was left unreleased due to its content and difficulties with the label</p>
          <p>On August 9, 2011, Sum 41 released the live album Live at the House of Blues, Cleveland 9.15.07 – a live
            recording of a show that took place on September 15, 2007, in Cleveland, Ohio, while the band was touring
            its previous album Underclass Hero.[75] A week later when the band was touring the US as part of the Vans
            Warped Tour, making up for dates the group had to cancel on its 2010 tour, they were forced once again to
            cancel all remaining dates, when Whibley re-injured his back after playing three shows.[76] It was announced
            on the band's official website that they would be postponing indefinitely all upcoming tour dates for 2011
            while Whibley underwent treatment. In an interview with Jason McCaslin that took place in Oppikoppi, he said
            that "it's safe to say Sum 41 won't have another album out for at least the next two years".[77] In 2011 Sum
            41 was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for the song "Blood in My Eyes",
            but lost to the Foo Fighters</p>
          <p>In February 2012 the band shot a music video for the song "Blood in My Eyes", the third single from the
            album, with director Michael Maxxis in Los Angeles.[78] Shooting took place on February 29 at the desert
            around the Los Angeles area;[79] it was released a month later.</p>
          <p>From November to December 2012 the band undertook the Does This Look Infected? 10th Anniversary Tour,
            touring the United States to celebrate the album's release in 2002</p>
          <p>On November 26, 2012, the band members revealed that they were taking a break from touring in 2013 to begin
            work on a new record</p>

          <h3>2019–present: Order in Decline</h3>
          <p>On April 22, 2019, the band announced via social media that they were returning with new music.[97] On
            April 24, they released the single, "Out For Blood" through Hopeless Records.[98][99] The same day, the band
            also announced their seventh studio album, Order in Decline, with a set release date of July 19,
            2019.[99][100] The second single from the album "A Death in the Family" was leaked online on June 10, 2019,
            before officially being released as a single the following day along with a music video.[101] On June 18,
            2019, "Never There" was released as the third single, along with a video.[102] On July 8, 2019, the band
            released "45 (A Matter of Time)" as the fourth single, along with a video.</p>

          <p class="lead">Before the release of Half Hour of Power, and up until the departures of Dave Baksh and Steve
            Jocz, Sum 41 occasionally played as an alter ego 1980s heavy metal band called Pain for Pleasure during
            shows.[104] The band appeared in Sum 41's music videos for "Fat Lip" and "We're All to Blame" and had at
            least one song on each of the band's first three releases.[105] The group's best known song under the Pain
            for Pleasure moniker is the song of the same name from All Killer No Filler, a track that remains the band's
            staple during live shows and features drummer Steve Jocz on lead vocals. During the Don't Call It a Sum-Back
            Tour in 2017, Pain for Pleasure appeared performing the song at the end of their show with guitarist Tom
            Thacker replacing Jocz as the vocalist.</p>
